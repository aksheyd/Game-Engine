TODO
# 1. meshs should have multiple types (square, triangle)
# 1. every game object needs a transform (tree-like)
# 2. every component needs a gameobject and transform
# 3. need a camera to actually test transform
# 1. have camera update all renderer objects in scene
4. rendering thread + input polling thread (fire and forget to event bus that signals rendering threads input callbacks?? idk)


clean up code base around all of this ^^^
